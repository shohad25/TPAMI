Dear Prof. XXX, 


\vspace{0.2cm}

It is our pleasure to submit a new manuscript entitled  ``{\it Accelerated Magnetic Resonance Imaging by Generative Adversarial Neural Networks}'' for
consideration by IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence journal. 
The manuscript is co-authored by Ohad Shitrit and Tammy Riklin Raviv.

A preliminary version of this work was presented at the Deep Learning in Medical Image Analysis workshop (DLMIA 2017), Quebec, Canada
(in conjunction with the MICCAI conference). The submitted manuscript is substantially
longer and more comprehensive. We further extended the scope of our framework using a more stabilized training regime and exploiting the sparsity in two dimensions. The method is now tested on a large, diverse publicly available dataset of raw images without pre-processing, and with much higher sampling factors. Furthermore, extensive experiments were conducted to demonstrate the clinical applicability of the proposed framework and the strength of performing the reconstruction directly from the k-space.

Thank you for your consideration of this manuscript. 

We look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,

Tammy Riklin-Raviv
